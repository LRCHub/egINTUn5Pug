I said come on, baby
Please throw this old dog a bone
I said come on, baby
Please throw this old dog a bone
Cause I'm driftin', an driftin'
Like a ship out on the sea.

I said, baby, baby, baby
I ain't got no place to stay
I said, baby, baby
I ain't got no place to stay
Well, well, well, I'm driftin' now baby
Lord, I'm driftin' from door to door

Lord, when I first met you, baby
Baby, way down south somewhere
When I first met you, baby
Baby, way down south somewhere
You didn't go no place now, baby-um
But the church an the Sunday school

You been up here in Detroit, baby
Go around to ev'ry notoriety joint in town
You been up here in old Detroit
Go around to ev'ry notoriety joint in town
